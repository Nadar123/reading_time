#Reading time Pluging

this is a reading time pluging for wordpress, the pluging can calculate the text/paragraph reading time. The plugin should allow multiple ways for embedding the “Reading Time” value in a theme:
-Using the shortcode [reading_time] in post content.
-By calling a php function named `the_reading_time()`.
-By echoing the return value of a php function named `get_reading_time()`.

The plugin should do nothing if the post it is presented in is not in the
supported post types configured in the admin settings page. click your checkbox in the setting pluging page in order to activate it.

-The plugin’s admin is partly translated using WordPress’ localization
 guidelines, (as a part of a task to show that i know the way to do it...)

-i use https://lando.dev as a wordpreass workspace
